## Diabetes Prediction - Beginner ML Project

This is a beginner-level machine learning project using the **Pima Indians Diabetes dataset** to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not.
Create a simple but effective ML model using Logistic Regression with Python and Scikit-learn.

Dataset which I used, [Pima Indians Diabetes dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selva86/datasets/master/PimaIndiansDiabetes.csv)
Contains medical data of 768 women (Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, etc.)

Technologies : Python ,Pandas, NumPy ,Matplotlib, Seaborn,Scikit-learn 

Content: 
1. Load and clean the dataset
2. Explore data with visualizations
3. Split into training/testing sets
4. Train a Logistic Regression model
5. Evaluate accuracy and performance


Model Accuracy
Model Accuracy achieved **~75% accuracy** (Evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score)
